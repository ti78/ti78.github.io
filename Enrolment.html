<div class="style-maintext"><h2>Who can Enrol?</h2> </div>
	

<div class="style-mosttext"><br>Sydney Catholic schools are open to all Catholic families, as well as families from Orthodox churches, families from other Christian Churches, and those from other faith traditions or non-religious backgrounds who are prepared to support the ethos, values and liturgical and sacramental practices of the Catholic Church.</br></div>	

	
<div class="style-maintext"><h2>When to Enrol?</h2> </div>
	
<div class="style-mosttext"><br>You can apply to enrol your child in a Sydney Catholic School at any time although the formal enrolment period commences in March. Primary school students must commence school before they turn six years of age, and applications are accepted in the year prior to commencement. Secondary colleges accept applications two years prior to commencement.</br></div>

<div class="style-maintext"><h2>Enrolment Process</h2> </div>

<div class="style-mosttext"><br>Before an enrolment is finalised, parents/carers are usually interviewed by the principal or a delegated staff member. Documents required at this interview include the completed enrolment form, birth certificate, baptismal certificate, immunisation statement, any relevant medical records or health assessments, and passport if you are newly arrived in Australia. Secondary schools may require academic results or reports from the student’s previous school.</br></div>

<div class="style-mosttext"><br>The processes and decision of enrolment are determined by the individual school based on the context of the parish and school community and in accordance with Sydney Catholic Schools’ Enrolment Policy.</br></div>
