	<header id="header"><h1>Inspired. Hope-filled. United. One school, duel campus, one community. Proudly Part Of The Community Of Sydney Catholic Schools.</h1></header> 


	<div class="style-maintext"><h2>Welcome</h2> </div>

	<div class="style-text"><br>Welcome to All Saints Catholic College fan page where we discuss everything there is to know about the school. All Saints Catholic College is a well established high-school in which students live a journey at One School across a Dual Campus as One Community. They experience alignment of their entire learning journey from K–12 in a contemporary school climate.  We place great importance on the development of the whole person: spiritually, academically, socially and physically.</div></br>
	
	<div class="style-text"><br>Students have access to specialised programs and the opportunity to learn in a safe, nurturing environment underpinned by gospel values. Our students are challenged within a dynamic and innovative curriculum to become independent thinkers willing to take risks and become lifelong learners.</div></br>
	
	<div class="style-manytext"><h2>When to Enrol</h2> </div>

<div class="style-text"><br>As a student of All Saints Catholic College, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our school’s fan page. I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce you to our school and share the school's stories and aspirations with you.</div></br>

<div class="style-text"><br>In 2020, the school and parish embark on a new model of schooling that will signal a new dawn for education. Our All Saints campuses will be the first fully operational Catholic systemic K–12 school in the Archdiocese of Sydney, operating across the two sites of Liverpool and Casula. Our endeavor is built upon the shoulders of the clergy, religious orders and parish community that have come before us.</div></br>

<div class="style-text"><br>As students traverse the full schooling journey, they will experience an alignment of the learning continuum across the full K–12 divide. In short, our unified All Saints community are pioneers operating as one school across a dual campus.<br></div>

<div class="style-text"><br>At All Saints students are offered a wealth of experiences; this website showcases many of these opportunities. We are justly proud of our school, students and teachers, support staff, parents and carers and the wider parish community, all of whom cooperate to create a college community that is noted for its inclusiveness and care.<br></div>
