	<nav class="style-text"><p><br>At All Saints Catholic College We commit to providing safe and supportive environments which nurture the wellbeing of all students and staff in our community, and hold firmly to the belief that they have a right to be safe, respected and valued in an inclusive environment. We know that when students are happy, they are more engaged with their learning.</br></p></nav>
	
	
	<div class="style-text"><p><br>Schools benefit from wellbeing initiatives and pastoral care support through Sydney Catholic Schools – in areas such as anti-bullying, positive behaviour, student counselling, refugee support and child protection – which range from universal support for all students, to targeted interventions for students with complex social and emotional needs.</br></p></div>	
		
	<div class="style-text"><p><br>All Saints Catholic College values the fostering of positive relationships as the key factor in the development of the whole person. Student wellbeing is at the core of Catholic school life; it is the heart of informing those committed to Christ and charged with student care. At All Saints, student wellbeing is the guiding principle of our pastoral care evidenced within our primary Buddy program to foster social skills, our appointed Leaders of Wellbeing for each Year group tasked with monitoring, challenging and advising students and our Years 11 and 12 pastoral care program with lessons in anti-bullying and cyberbullying. Our philosophy of student wellbeing is born out of Catholic teaching based on the unique human dignity of each person created in the image and likeness of God.</br></p></div>
